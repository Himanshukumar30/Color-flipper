I developed this project to demonstrate my skills for JavaScript

## Description

- This project consists of color flip by two ways:
1. Generate color from the pre-selected list of array.
2. Generate randon hex color code.
- Once the user select one of the ways to flip color, it loads the specific page.
- Once they click the button, eventlistner in JavaScript calls the function.
- In case of pre-selected color generator, random number is generated which corresponds to the index of an array. This is then displayed as background color.
- In case of hex code generator, a random number is picked from array which concatenates together to form a hex code. This is then displayed as background color.

# Development
- Start by creating index HTML and its styling which will be same for both the ways of color flip.
- Create JavaScript which picks random color in case of pre-selected color generated and modifies the DOM element to change the background color to the random color picked from array. This is done by using even listener for click even on the button.
- For hex code generator, create a duplicate of index file and name it as hex.html
- Javascript involves picking a random number from array which concatenates together to form a hex code. This is then displayed as background color using an eve listener for click event on the button.
